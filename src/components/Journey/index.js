                It is grateful to have an opportunity to work at a Hyundai
                Motors Affiliate, Trinion America. Trinion America Inc. provides
                transporting services and warehouse management services. Working
                in the accounting team, I prepare financial statements and
                reports, advising the top management on sales practices and
                strategies. As the business grows fast, the team I work with
                focuses on strategic analysis for more profitable acquisitions.
                In several projects, my role is to break down the costs and
                expenses, measure future cash flow projections, and estimate an
                acceptable rate of return for acquisition. I am detail-oriented
                and numeric-oriented, and these personal traits help me deduce
                more accurate P&amp;L projections.

                I have been in the food industry before pursuing my financial
                career. I had been working and studying in my entire college
                year. I chose to work at a restaurant because of the flexible
                work schedules. A restaurant is not a simple place as many
                thought it was. I would arguably say that restaurant jobs are
                quite fast-paced and stressful. I have witnessed many restaurant
                workers fail to manage their anger and anxiety at work. However,
                I took my job differently and ceased criticizing what I was
                doing and what I would have done. Instead, I decided to be
                grateful, diligent, and reliable. I established good
                relationships with my co-workers and engaged with customers. I
                never dropped smiles when I took care of my customers. It was
                not to make more money out of gratuity but to establish the
                business mind. After all, I had been promoted three times in the
                first six months and became a general manager at Blue Ocean
                Sushi group, operating 7 restaurants in San Diego, CA.

                UC San Diego presented a variety of exciting, engaging, and
                diverse cultures. My college year at UCSD offered an opportunity
                of engaging with phenomenal faculty and peers. My experience
                with professors integrated the abstract concepts of economy and
                finance, turning out to be a concrete understanding of business
                and investment. I enjoyed peer-to-peer practice outside of
                lectures and supplementary activities to improve my insight.
                Professors liked to be challenged by students to share thoughts
                and ideas. The faculty did not only focus on students' academic
                attainment but also did they emphasize the importance of
                diversity.

                follow new IT technologies, and Web3 got my attention. I
                researched some good places to start. The developer course was
                the thing. There are always lots of fun stuff to learn in web
                application development. I enjoyed every corner, and I keep
                expanding skills and knowledges. Now, I'm learning Data
                Analytics to integrate my financial insight with my IT
                knowledges.
