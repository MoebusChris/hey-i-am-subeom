                    I joined the HR team after 3 months temporary position. As a
                    HR specialist, I experienced many aspect of business
                    operation and learned how to work on a team well.

                    Landing finance position, all I learned in college begins
                    shining. In financial accounting team, I helped two CPAs to
                    prepare financial statements, budgeting, and help management
                    make smarter decision. As the business grows fast, the team
                    I work with participate in several projects for new
                    businesses and company acquisition. My team analyzes the
                    predicted profit and cost, measuring future cash flow
                    projections, and estimate an acceptable rate of return for
                    acquisition.

                    I handle financial data everyday, and it is painful to
                    analyze a problem with a spreadsheet and my gut instincts.
                    That is where my curiosity and everyday-learner mind set are
                    kicked in. I was looking for a way to grow my full-stack
                    development experience, and data analytics will be it.

                  I had been working and studying in my entire college year.
                  Coming from working class family, financial struggle is always
                  an obstacle. I had to work harder to pay tuition and to live
                  off. I took lectures in school until afternoon and worked
                  until midnight, then studied class materials until morning.
                  This routine had been going on years.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  I worked hard, established good relationships with my
                  co-workers, and engaged with customers. I eventually
                  understood the importance of relationship with team members
                  and customers. My name began to appear on Blue Ocean's Yelp
                  page shortly. I promoted 3 times in half years, then the owner
                  offered me general manager position.

                  UC San Diego presented a variety of exciting, engaging, and
                  diverse cultures. My college year at UCSD offered an
                  opportunity of engaging with phenomenal faculty and peers. My
                  experience with professors integrated the abstract concepts of
                  economy and finance, turning out to be a concrete
                  understanding of business and investment. I enjoyed
                  peer-to-peer practice outside of lectures and supplementary
                  activities to improve my insight. Professors liked to be
                  challenged by students to share thoughts and ideas.

                <p>
                  The experience in UCSD became compass to guide me. The spirit
                  and philosophy from professors and peers are now a part of me,
                  not fear to light up.
                </p>
                The faculty did not only focus on students' academic attainment
                but also did they emphasize the importance of diversity.
